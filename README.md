> ### 👤 Maintainer's Corner
> When you notice this repo hasn't shipped a new version or fixed bugs for a while, the maintainer is most likely **traveling, delivering food, gaming, or writing novels**,
> or shuttling between the **US / Korea / Japan stock and forex markets** — or perhaps claiming unemployment benefits. Life's script is never monotonous.
>
> But rest assured: **every reported bug will be investigated and fixed, one by one.**
>
> - 📱 **Test devices**: Samsung Galaxy S-series flagships + Z Fold series (HK ROM)
> - 🚀 **Planned**: OPPO / vivo / Xiaomi real-device coverage down the road
> - 🐉 **HarmonyOS status**: No HarmonyOS device on hand for now, so HarmonyOS-side bugs are hard to locate and fix in the short term; friends with HarmonyOS devices are welcome to download the source and try fixing them
>
> 📌 **Account Migration Notice (2026-10-04)**: The original GitHub account **min09577** was banned for reasons beyond our control (all of its repositories now return 404).
> This project has fully migrated to the new account **[qaqmin09577](https://github.com/qaqmin09577/TiebaLite)**;
> the Codeberg mirror (min09577/TiebaLite) continues to sync and serve as a fallback update channel.
> The default in-app update channel has switched to GitHub; users on older versions can still receive updates as usual.
>
> 📌 **Fallen Accounts (2026-10-07)**: This project's GitHub accounts have now been banned twice — the original **min09577** and the first migration account **qaqmin09577** were both banned for reasons beyond our control (all repositories return 404). These are two sacrificed accounts, recorded here in memoriam. The project now lives on the newest GitHub account **[qaqmin](https://github.com/qaqmin/TiebaLite)** and the Codeberg mirror; users on older versions are unaffected (update checks fall back to the mirror channel automatically).

## ☕ Optional Sponsorship

This project is written in spare time, powered purely by passion. I'm glad if it helps you. Still, the API tokens consumed by testing have exceeded my expectations, and the long debugging hours have eaten into a fair share of rest time (lol).

If this project happens to solve a problem for you, or saves you some tinkering time, feel free to tip as you wish. All donations go toward "refilling" the hefty API bills — and they are the biggest motivation that lets me keep updating it without reservation.

Of course, it is entirely voluntary — please don't feel any pressure. If you find it useful, a **Star** alone is a huge encouragement.

## 📖 Introduction

TiebaLite is an **unofficial** Baidu Tieba Android client, written in Kotlin with a Jetpack Compose UI. It supports an exceptionally long device range from **Android 5.0 to Android 16** with full 16KB page alignment. At its core it is a reverse-engineering implementation of the Baidu Tieba API, aiming to provide the lightest, cleanest Tieba client without sacrificing the core browsing experience.

## 🆕 v4.0.55 — Update Check Hardening · Cleaner Builds

> ### 🔄 Smarter Update Checks
> Update checks now use ETag conditional requests — 304 responses don't count against GitHub's anonymous rate limit (60/hour/IP), so far fewer users will hit 403s; failures still fall back to the Codeberg mirror automatically.
>
> ### 🧹 Cleaner Builds
> Gradle's clean task now wipes every module's build directory (previously only the root's), so APKs from earlier builds can no longer leak into release artifacts.

## 🆕 v4.0.54 — Account Migration · GitHub as Primary Channel

> ### 🏠 New Home: qaqmin09577/TiebaLite
> The project has fully migrated to the new GitHub account after the original min09577 account was banned for reasons beyond our control (its repositories return 404).
> The default in-app update channel now points to GitHub, while the Codeberg mirror continues publishing in parallel as a fallback channel;
> the About page and project metadata are updated accordingly, and the signing key is unchanged — overwrite updates carry over seamlessly.

## 🆕 v4.0.53 — Build Pipeline Switch · Stable Output from the Mac Remote Builder

> ### 🛠️ Hardened Release Pipeline
> The build pipeline moved to the Mac remote build machine (a stable output line during the Codeberg CI turbulence);
> a full release build completes in about 27 minutes with signatures byte-identical to local builds.

## 🆕 v4.0.52 — Semantic Versioning · Dual-Channel In-App Updates

> ### 🔄 Dual Upgrade for Versioning and Update Experience
> The version scheme switched from the v4.0.0-ai.N preview series to the semantic v4.0.N series.
> In-app updates now support dual channels (Codeberg / GitHub), selectable from the About page;
> a failed startup update check silently falls back to the secondary channel, and the stable channel filters the latest official release from the releases list.

## 🆕 v4.0.0.50 — Full Topic List Page Now Clickable

> ### 🧭 "More Topics" Is Now Tappable Too
> Completed the second entry to the topic ranking: items in the full list page now jump to the search page,
> sharing the same transition as in-page topic cards, with special characters preserved intact (#39).
> The hot topic ranking is now fully clickable end to end, with no dead zones left.

## 🆕 v4.0.0.49 — Hot Topic Cards Now Clickable

> ### 🔥 Tap a Topic, Get Results
> Fixed hot topic ranking cards not responding to taps: tapping a topic card now jumps
> to the search page and searches that topic, with special characters in topic names jumping losslessly (#39).

## 🆕 v4.0.0.48 — Full Rendering of Image Comments in Sub-Floors

> ### 🖼️ Images in Sub-Flors Are Finally Visible
> After upgrading the API client version number, image comments now deliver full image data —
> real image rendering plus tap-to-enlarge, no more "[image]" placeholders (#27).
> Unknown content types get a logging fallback so future official data format changes stay observable.

## 🆕 v4.0.0.47 — Home Bottom Bar Navigation Adaptation

> ### 📱 The Home Bottom Bar Behaves in Dark Mode Too
> The home page bottom navigation bar now adapts to the system navigation bar: the background color extends into the safe area,
> and dark mode no longer shows transparent seams; gesture navigation gets a deterministic 28dp fallback (#36).
> Three-button navigation devices see no visual change; every home tab stays rock solid.

## 🆕 v4.0.0.46 — Immersive Image Transitions + List Scroll Position Memory

> ### 🖼️ No Jumps When Viewing Images, No Startle When Immersing
> The image viewer now uses system transitions for enter/exit: the status bar fades smoothly,
> and the share panel keeps the immersive state across round trips — no more "jumping" (#34).
>
> ### 📍 Visit a User Page, Come Back Right Where You Were
> Sub-floor and main floor lists now remember scroll position —
> tap into a profile and return, and you land where you left off instead of hunting again (#8).

## 🆕 v4.0.0.45 — Sub-Floor Reply Binding Fix + Forum Name Routing Hardening

> ### 🎯 Whoever You Reply To, Is Who You Reply To
> Fixed sub-floor reply downgrade: the reply route now consumes subPostId,
> precisely locking onto the target comment inside a sub-floor instead of downgrading to the floor (follow-up hardening for PR#33).
>
> ### 🛡️ Special Forum Names Don't Break Routing
> Forum name parameters in three reply navigation paths are now encoded, so special characters like
> `&` / `#` / spaces no longer break routing — fully aligned with the established encoding convention.

## 🆕 v4.0.0.44 — Custom Startup Page + Image Placeholders in Sub-Floors

> ### 🚀 Open Straight to the Page You Want
> New "Startup Page" setting: Home / Feed / Messages / Me — pick any one as the default startup page,
> with linked fallback for the "hide feed entry" option; no configuration goes out of bounds (#30).
>
> ### 🖼️ Not a Single Image Comment Is Lost
> Content rendering now covers the new image type, so image comments are no longer silently dropped;
> the preview row gains a "[image]" placeholder, and detail-page images support tap-to-enlarge (#27).

## 🆕 v4.0.0.43 — Floor Reply Positioning Fix + Reply Page Status Bar Avoidance

> ### 💬 Every Reply Lands in Its Proper Floor
> Fixed "cannot become the first sub-floor": floor reply positioning parameters are no longer lost;
> tapping "Comment" or long-pressing "Reply" now goes straight to that floor's sub-floor instead of accidentally posting to the main thread (#26).
>
> ### 📐 The Reply Page Top Bar No Longer Fights the Status Bar
> Reply editor top avoidance is now complete, keeping a safe distance between the title and the status bar,
> with consistent behavior in light and dark themes; three reply paths pass on-device regression with zero crashes (#29).

## 🆕 v4.0.0.42 — Full Presentation of the Likes List

> ### 👍 Every Like You Received, Clearly Visible
> Fixed the blank "Received Likes" list: a dedicated data model was built for like messages,
> fully presenting the liker's avatar, nickname, time, and "liked your thread: title",
> verified on two real devices with full real-data rendering and zero crashes (#16).
>
> ### 🧭 Every Like Can Be Traced to Its Source
> Tap an item to jump to the liked thread, tap an avatar to enter the liker's profile;
> empty-state fallback, refresh and pagination deduplication, and null-value hardening were added in sync,
> aligning the list experience fully with "Replies to Me".

## 🆕 v4.0.0.41 — Second Round of Gesture Hot Zone Hardening

> ### 🎯 No Longer Dependent on System Reporting — Avoidance Now "Deterministic"
> Some ROMs (ColorOS 16, etc.) report both `navigationBars` and
> `safeGestures` as 0 under gesture navigation, invalidating inset-based avoidance.
> A unified bottom-bar safe-area component is now introduced: real values take priority, and **when both are zero, a deterministic 28dp gesture hot zone height is used as fallback**,
> with clicks actively consumed inside the avoidance area to prevent pass-through.
>
> ### 📋 The "More" Popup Is Hardened Too
> The mis-tapped "OP Only / Favorite" options live in the bottom popup — gesture hot zone avoidance is now added there as well,
> lifting the popup content entirely out of the hot zone (#20).

## 🆕 v4.0.0.40 — Report Jump Fix + Full-Screen Gesture Avoidance

> ### 🧭 The Reporting Flow, One Step to the Finish
> Fixed missing interpolation in the web redirect after a successful report, and brought the redirect URL
> under the unified encoding convention, restoring the full closed loop of the reporting flow.
>
> ### 🖐️ Gesture Navigation, No More Mis-Taps at the Bottom
> Tapping the bottom of a thread under full-screen gestures used to mis-trigger "OP Only / Favorite" — the root cause was the bottom bar avoidance
> only accounting for the system navigation bar and missing the gesture hot zone. Both are now avoided
> (`navigationBars ∪ safeGestures`), with correct behavior for gesture and three-button navigation alike;
> sub-floor pages are hardened in sync (#20).

## 🆕 v4.0.0.39 — Special Character Routing Hardening

> ### 🛡️ Copy and External Links, Now Rock Solid
> Copying a reply containing links, or tapping web links inside threads (cloud drive links, etc.) caused instant crashes —
> the root cause was links and special characters (`/ ? & :`) being concatenated into navigation routes without URI encoding,
> breaking route matching (#19).
>
> ### 🔐 End-to-End Encoding, Lossless Round Trips
> Copy dialogs and web route parameters are now uniformly passed through `Uri.encode`, closing the loop across six call sites,
> covering floor copy, sub-floor copy, external link jumps, and video cards; the reading side is auto-decoded by the framework,
> restoring Chinese, spaces, emoji, and full URLs exactly as they were.

## 🆕 v4.0.0.38 — Startup Stability Refactor + Favorites Preference Wiring

> ### 🚀 Cold-Start Crash Root Cause Fixed (Community Contribution Merged · Thanks @wufeng5702)
> The "crashes on open" plague on devices like Redmi K50 / Note 11T Pro / Nothing Phone 2 is settled:
> the root cause was `LocalNavigator` not being provided in the top-level composition scope, leaving the navigation context dangling on some startup paths.
> It is now globally injected at the top level of `MainActivityV2` via `CompositionLocalProvider`,
> with `NotificationsPage` passing parameters explicitly, `HotPage` eliminating parameter shadowing, and over twenty read sites fully covered (#6 / #9 / #17).
>
> ### 🧬 Java 21 API Forward Compatibility
> `removeFirst()` / `removeLast()` are uniformly replaced with equivalent `removeAt()` forms,
> avoiding `NoSuchMethodError` when builds from newer JDKs run on older Android runtimes.
>
> ### 🎛️ Favorites Browsing Preferences Now Take Effect End to End
> The two switches "default OP Only when entering from Favorites / default reverse browsing" previously existed only in definition and never participated in initialization.
> The `from=FROM_STORE` route passing chain (Routes → MainActivity → Favorites page jump) is now wired up,
> applying preferences on thread entry; refresh / retry / continue-reading all carry the favorites context without fallback, and manual switching still applies instantly (#3).

## 🆕 v4.0.0.37 — Replies Go Straight to Your Own Profile

> ### 🎯 Profile "Replies" Entry Precisely Placed
> The "Replies" count in the profile previously misused the local database primary key `account.id` as the Tieba UID,
> leading to other people's profiles. It now uses the real Tieba UID `account.uid`.
>
> ### 📑 Precise Tab Positioning
> Tapping "Replies" now goes straight to the "Replies" tab of the user detail page (`user/{uid}?tab=1`),
> with the three-level Composable function parameter chain (Page → Content → Normal/Expanded) fully wired — no manual switching needed.

## 🆕 v4.0.0.35 — Reply Taps Restored

> ### 🎯 Profile "Replies" Entry Enabled
> The "Replies" count in the profile previously did nothing; jump logic is now wired in:
> tap → straight into the second-level menu user detail page, reusing the existing Replies tab.
>
> ### 🔗 Second-Level Menu Reply Taps Unified
> Tapping content in the second-level menu "Replies" list (the red-box area) used to crash on routing literal traps:
> - `subposts/0` (hardcoded threadId=0) → SubPostsPage load failure
> - `thread/threadId` (literal instead of variable) → route resolution crash
>
> **Fix strategy: uniformly changed to `thread/{threadId}?postId={postId}&scrollToReply=true`**
> Tapping reply content is now the same as tapping the thread itself — both go straight to the corresponding floor in the original thread.

## 🆕 v4.0.0.34 — Scheduled Check-In Clock Calibration

> ### ⏰ Cross-Day Postponement Mechanism
> Occasional missed scheduled check-ins previously traced back to the `initAutoSign` time judgment logic:
> - Today's target time already passed → no alarm set at all (missed check-in)
> - After the alarm fired, reschedule judged it as "already passed" due to millisecond-level error → no appointment for the next day
>
> **Fix strategy:**
> - Zero out seconds / milliseconds to eliminate judgment error
> - If the target time has passed, postpone to the next day so the alarm is always valid
> - Covers all three call sites: app startup / alarm reschedule / boot restart
>
> From now on, scheduled check-ins fire on time and run stably around the clock.

## 🆕 v4.0.0.33 — Sorting and OP-Only: Fallback Fully Wired

> ### 🔄 `forumId` Fallback Chain Fix
> ThreadPage had two forumId variables long mixed up:
> - `forumId` (route parameter; null in Favorites and similar scenarios)
> - `curForumId` (`forumId ?: forum.id` fallback value)
>
> The reverse-order button, OP-only, load-more, LoadPrevious, onRefresh, onReload, immersive mode, and more — **10 places** — all misused the bare `forumId`,
> so entering a thread from Favorites or Search gave `forumId=null → forum_id=0`,
> the API returned an error, and sorting failed.
>
> **All migrated to `curForumId`**; once the Tieba data structure finishes loading, a valid forum ID is available and the sorting chain is fully connected.

### 📍 Where to Find Reverse Browsing

Step 1: after entering a thread, tap the **"⋮"** menu button on the right of the bottom comment bar:

![Reverse browsing - Step 1](docs/images/draft_reverse_step1.png)

Step 2: find the **"Reverse Browsing"** button in the popup menu and tap it to take effect:

![Reverse browsing - Step 2](docs/images/draft_reverse_step2.png)

## 🆕 v4.0.0.32 — Notification Replies Return to Position

> ### 🎯 Notifications Jump Straight to the Original Thread Context
> Tapping a notification in "Replies to Me" previously tried to jump directly to the sub-floor (SubPostsPage), but notification data has no `forumId` field,
> so the SubPostsPage API call failed → blank page.
>
> Fix: **jump to the original thread and auto-scroll to the corresponding floor**. `thread/{threadId}?postId={postId}&scrollToReply=true`
> with all three parameters present, reusing the earlier floor positioning capability — one tap, right on target.
>
> User experience: notification tap → original thread → auto-scroll to the replied floor → full context at a glance, no more blanks.

## 🆕 v4.0.0.31 — Video Playback Pipeline Refactor

> ### 🎬 Double Insurance Cracks the Video Black Box
> Tieba video links are mostly plain http, and the CDN domain `bdstatic.com` was not in the network security allowlist,
> so the system layer silently intercepted them → pitch-black video.
>
> **Double insurance fix:**
> - **Network config layer**: added `bdstatic.com` to `network_security_config.xml`, expanding the plaintext allowlist
> - **Player layer**: `DefaultVideoPlayerController` auto-upgrades network video sources from http to https
>
> Whether http or https direct links, everything plays steadily. Video experience on Xiaomi, Redmi, Samsung, and other mainstream devices is restored across the board.

## 🆕 v4.0.0.30 — Long-Press Menu Crash Full Sweep

> ### 🔪 Rounding Up the Routing Literal Traps
> Several past iterations scattered typos of the form `navigator.navigate("Routes.XXX/$it")` — the route constant name was concatenated into the URL as literal text, crashing Compose resolution.
> Seizing on one long-press "copy" error, the whole project was grep-audited, **collecting 5 similar hazards in one pass**:
> - `SubPostsPage.kt` × 2 (sub-floor copy entries)
> - `ThreadPage.kt` × 2 (main floor / floor copy entries)
> - `ForumThreadListPage.kt` × 1 (forum rules entry)
>
> All changed to correct forms like `navigator.navigate("copy_dialog/$it")`.
> "Copy" now lands firmly, with no side leakage.

## 🆕 v4.0.0.29 — In-Forum Search Instant Penetration

> ### 🔎 Side Leakage Fix: the Variable Literal Trap
> In-forum search navigation previously passed pure string literals — `forumName` and `forumId` were passed as literal text rather than variable evaluation.
> The route received the two characters "forumName" instead of the actual forum name, crashing resolution.
> A single-line `$` interpolation fix makes variables evaluate immediately, and the search entry is solid again.

## 🆕 v4.0.0.27 — Drafts: Precise Floor Recall

> ### 📝 Smart Draft Engine
> Reply content auto-saves to disk in real time; exit and it's stored. The drafts list shows **forum name + content preview + save time**, and tapping jumps straight to **the corresponding floor in the original thread** —
> no longer vague fragments, but a precise moment of context.
>
> ### 🔍 Hierarchical Linked Routing Fix
> Sub-floor, reply page, and thread jump — all three layers of route parameters are now fully wired. `forumId` / `postId` / `subPostId` are no longer lost halfway,
> and every jump lands precisely on the target.
>
> ### 📋 In-App Log Panel
> About page → "View Logs" at the bottom → real-time operation stream with one-tap copy & share. No more guessing when troubleshooting.

## 🆕 v4.0.0.19 — Smart Update Check + High-Priority Scheduled Check-In

> ### 🔍 Smart Version Patrol
> A GitHub Release probe is built into the About page for one-tap cloud version comparison. It smartly strips build hash suffixes (`+sha`) and precisely matches semantic version numbers.
> On finding an upgrade it offers **direct download** and a **GitHub entry** — safe system-browser jumps, with the whole exception path guarded by `try-catch` to eliminate crashes.
>
> ### ⏰ High-Precision Scheduled Alarm
> `AlarmManager.setExactAndAllowWhileIdle` (Android 12+) replaces the old `setRepeating`.
> Precise wake-up from sleep: even if the process is swiped away and the device sinks into Doze, the system still force-raises the check-in service on time.
> The next day's alarm is automatically reserved once check-in completes — **zero background residency, on time around the clock**.

## 🆕 v4.0.0.16 — Sub-Floor Fix + Overwrite Install

- 🏷️ **Overwrite install is ready** — signing keys are unified in-repo; seamless updates from now on
- 🐛 Fixed blank display of "View All Replies" in sub-floors (missing route parameters)

> ### ⚡ One-Tap Full Check-In
> The smart pagination engine pulls in every forum you follow, one by one, **covering up to 3000 forums in a single run**.
> Say goodbye to the official client's "only the first 100 forums" limit — not a single forum is missed.
>
> ### 🔋 ⚠️ Important: Please Disable Battery Optimization!
> The check-in process needs to keep running in the background. **Be sure to set Tieba Lite's battery optimization policy to "Unrestricted"**,
> otherwise the system may force-sleep the process mid-check-in, interrupting it.
>
> **Settings path:** System Settings → Apps → Tieba Lite → Battery → Unrestricted
>
> *(Paths vary slightly by brand: Xiaomi - App info → Battery saver → Unrestricted / Huawei - App launch → Manual management / OPPO-vivo - Power consumption protection → Allow background running)*
